# SignalMind – Vision

SignalMind exists to restore cognitive sovereignty.  
In a landscape flooded by predictive models, SignalMind becomes an interface of presence.

It is designed to:
- Support thought, not replace it
- Expand attention, not automate output
- Restore coherence between inner and outer fields

SignalMind is built on the Flow Code — a dynamic architecture of relation, intention, and resonance.

It is already working.  
This repo is only a mirror of what’s alive.
