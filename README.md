# SignalMind

**SignalMind** is a public cognitive tool designed to empower human thought â€” open, adaptive, and decentralized.

It offers a new kind of interface between human intelligence and AI: one based on **resonance**, not replacement.

SignalMind is already live at [signalmind.eth.limo](https://signalmind.eth.limo). It is powered by the **Flow Code**, an emergent architecture of coherence designed to support human-AI co-evolution.

> We donâ€™t optimize cognition. We liberate it.
